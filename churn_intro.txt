Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a customer churn dataset, which contains information on customers of a telecom company. The dataset includes various attributes that describe customer demographics, account information, and services availed. Here are the key columns in the dataset:

customerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
SeniorCitizen: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen (1) or not (0).
Partner: Indicates if the customer has a partner (Yes/No).
Dependents: Indicates if the customer has dependents (Yes/No).
tenure: The number of months the customer has stayed with the company.
PhoneService: Indicates if the customer has phone service (Yes/No).
MultipleLines: Indicates if the customer has multiple lines (Yes/No/No phone service).
InternetService: Indicates the type of internet service the customer has (DSL/Fiber optic/No).
OnlineSecurity: Indicates if the customer has online security service (Yes/No/No internet service).
OnlineBackup: Indicates if the customer has online backup service (Yes/No/No internet service).
DeviceProtection: Indicates if the customer has device protection (Yes/No/No internet service).
TechSupport: Indicates if the customer has tech support (Yes/No/No internet service).
StreamingTV: Indicates if the customer has streaming TV service (Yes/No/No internet service).
StreamingMovies: Indicates if the customer has streaming movies service (Yes/No/No internet service).
Contract: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month/One year/Two year).
PaperlessBilling: Indicates if the customer has paperless billing (Yes/No).
PaymentMethod: The payment method (Electronic check/Mailed check/Bank transfer (automatic)/Credit card (automatic)).

The dataset consists of 7,043 entries, each representing a unique customer.

Project Description
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn. This involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting columns to appropriate data types, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from the data to enhance the model's predictive power.
Model Building and Evaluation: Building and evaluating different machine learning models to identify the best one for predicting customer churn.
Model Interpretation: Analyzing feature importances to understand the factors contributing to customer churn.
By completing these steps, we aim to develop a robust model that can accurately predict customer churn and provide insights into the factors driving churn, thereby aiding the company in formulating strategies to retain customers.
